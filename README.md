# KiCad Footprint Libraries

This repository *will be* where KiCad footprint libraries are located. 

Currently, each footprint library is hosted on GitHub as an [individual repository](https://github.com/KiCad?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=.pretty&type=&language=). This is unmaintainable and these libraries will be merged (here) for the v5 KiCad release.

Until that time, the various .pretty repositories will be hosted here as _submodules_.
